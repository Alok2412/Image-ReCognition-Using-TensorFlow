# Image-ReCognition-Using-TensorFlow

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

# Labels

Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

> 0 T-shirt/top

> 1 Trouser

> 2 Pullover

> 3 Dress

> 4 Coat

> 5 Sandal

> 6 Shirt

> 7 Sneaker

> 8 Bag

> 9 Ankle boot
